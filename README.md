This project consists of OOP, including transaction handling. The project is designed to manage data in a relational database with support for complex transactions. 
It showcases best practices for database interaction, including error handling, transaction management, and applying OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to structure the application.

Features:
- Database Interaction via JDBC: The project uses JDBC for connecting to a MySql Database and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Transaction Handling: Implements transaction management using JDBC's commit and rollback features to ensure data consistency and integrity. This is crucial for handling complex operations like transferring money between accounts or processing multi-step orders.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
  * Encapsulation: Classes that encapsulate database logic and data operations.
  * Inheritance: Utilizes inheritance to create reusable and extensible class structures.
  * Polymorphism: Demonstrates polymorphic behavior where appropriate for simplifying and extending operations.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling using try-catch blocks to manage exceptions and ensure smooth transactions.
- Database Connection Pooling: Efficient use of database connections for optimal performance when managing multiple simultaneous database queries.
Technologies Used:
  Java: Core programming language for building the application.
  JDBC: For establishing database connections and performing CRUD operations.
  MySQL: For storing and managing data.
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Leveraging OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation for structuring the codebase.
  Transaction Handling: Using JDBC's transaction management techniques to handle complex data modifications.
